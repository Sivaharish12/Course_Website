                    The speaker starts the video with explaining what cloud computing is. Cloud computing refers to data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than on your local computer. The cloud is a big building filled with servers that are all networked together and can be accessed on the internet.
                    <br><br>
                    The purpose of cloud computing is to provide services to clients. A company or individual can use cloud computing to outsource their computing workload to a third party provider. This can save them money and time, as they don't have to worry about maintaining their own servers and software.

                    This video is about Platform as a Service (PaaS) and it is explained through the analogy of cars and cloud computing.
                    PaaS is a type of cloud computing service that provides a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It is like renting a car, where the vendor provides the car and the developer just needs to drive it.
                    <br><br>
                    It is fast and easy to get an app up and running.
                    It is easy to create and delete resources, which is important for temporary apps.
                    It can be cost-effective, as you only pay for the resources you use.
                    It frees up IT staff to focus on other tasks.
                    It provides access to a variety of tools and services.
