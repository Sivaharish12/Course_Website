                    The video covers the basics of Python programming, including:
                    <br>
                    Operators: arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as comparison operators like greater than, less than, and equal to
                    Variables: how to store and retrieve data
                    Functions: how to define and call functions, and how to use them to return values
                    Conditional statements: how to control the flow of your program using if, else, and elif statements
                    Loops: how to repeat a block of code multiple times using for and while loops
                    <br><br>
                    Lists: how to create and manipulate lists of data
                    Strings: how to work with text data
                    Dictionaries: how to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs

                <div class="course-description">The speaker, Jim, starts the video by explaining why OOP is important for software developers. He says that understanding OOP can help you become a better Python developer and land your first job as a software engineer.
                    <br><br>
                    The basics of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods
                    Inheritance, which is the ability of a class to inherit properties from another class
                    Polymorphism, which is the ability of an object to take on different forms
                    The speaker uses a store management system as an example to illustrate these concepts. He shows how you can create classes to represent different types of items in the store, such as phones and laptops.
