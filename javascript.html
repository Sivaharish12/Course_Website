                    This video is a tutorial about object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript. The speaker, Mosh Hamedani, starts the video with a brief introduction to OOP and its core concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Then, he dives into the details of each concept using real-world examples and code snippets.
                    <br><br>
                    Encapsulation: Grouping related variables and functions into a single unit called an object. This helps to improve code organization and maintainability.
                    Abstraction: Hiding the internal implementation details of an object and only exposing its essential functionalities through methods. This makes the code easier to understand and use.

                <div class="course-description">This video is a course introduction to Javascript data structures. The instructor, Maximilian Schwarzmuller, will be teaching different data structures, including built-in and custom ones.
                    <br>
                    The course will start with the built-in data structures such as arrays, objects, maps, and sets. Then, it will move on to custom data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
                    <br><br>
                    In the lecture, Maximilian explained what data structures are and why we need them. He also covered the four main data structures in Javascript: arrays, objects, maps, and sets.
